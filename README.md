Hi, my name is Britton Kitchell.

I am a full stack developer who is currently focused on the following technologies:
  - React
  - Redux
  - JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Node
  - Express
  - GraphQL
  - Postgres
  - MongoDB

I have over 6 years of experience in .NET development with VB and C#, but am hoping to transition to a more JavaScript-centered stack in the near future. 
I have been working on a full stack JavaScript program through Treehouse, and doing self-study with several books to this end. 
Much of the content on my GitHub is related to those endeavors.

I can be contacted at: brittonashford@gmail.com or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/britton-kitchell/)
